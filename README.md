# optimization_project
## 1.file description
There are six source code files and three folders in the repository.  
The folder **net_parameter** is used to store neural network parameters.  
The folder **xls_file**      is used to store training data and test data for neural network.  
The folder **data_for_plot** is used to store plotting data.  
Theere are three subfolders **for_LHD**, **for_regularization** and **for_optimization** in the folder **data_for_plot**.  
The file **optimal_lhd.py**            is used to generate an optimal Latin hypercube design.  
The file **pynet_for_test.py**         is used to illustrate the predicted functions under different regularization parameters.  
The file **generate_sampling_data.py** is used to generate training data and test data for neural network.  
The file **pynet.py**                  is used to train and save neural network.  
The file **stochastic_ranking.py**          is used to optimize objective function subjected to constraints by stochastic ranking.  
The file **modified_stochastic_ranking.py** is used to optimize objective function subjected to constraints by modified stochastic ranking.
